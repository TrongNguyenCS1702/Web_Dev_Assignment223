How to Run?

Install XAMPP, start XAMPP Control Panel and start Apache and MySQL.

After you finish downloading the project, unzip the project file and head over to your XAMPP directory. There you’ll find a folder naming “htdocs”.

Inside the “htdocs” folder, paste the project folder (not the .zip one, but the extracted one).

Open your favorite browser; Then, go to the URL “http://localhost/phpmyadmin“.

Create a Database in PHPMyAdmin with init.sql, named "figure_sell"

After setting up all these, go to the URL “http://localhost/[PROJECT_FOLDER_NAME ]/“.

For example, if you want to go to admin_login, go to the URL "http://localhost/[PROJECT_FOLDER_NAME ]/main/index.php?action=admin_login

All the login details are provided inside the database, check that out and enter them in order to use it.
